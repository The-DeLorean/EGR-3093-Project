FPGA-based Videogame
Objective

    Present the proposal of a videogame implementation using the FPGA selected for this course

Instructions 

    Select an existing videogame (preferably classic) the team wishes to implement.
    Consider the interfacing options offered by the peripherals of your development board.
    Implementing additional circuitry is also accepted.
    The videogame implementation must be connected with each topic presented in this course: combinational logic, sequential logic circuits (flip-flops, counters, and data storage), binary arithmetic, and state machines. 
    The project will be developed in four stages, one per topic mentioned above.
    The game must have at least the following qualities:
        Real-time scorekeeping
        Username storage
        Human-machine interface (e.g., screen, LEDs, buttons, controller, etc.)
        Change of difficulty over time.

Recommendations

    Ensure that your project is feasible. Investigate the capabilities of your board or what others have achieved with similar FPGAs.
    Highlight how your proposal fulfills each requirement.
    Consider the possible users of your game as non-technical people.
    Do not limit yourself by the peripherals offered on your board or the topics covered in the course.
